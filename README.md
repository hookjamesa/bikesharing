# NYC Citi Bike

## Overview

This analysis is an example of Tableau visualizations using New York City CitiBike data from August 2019. It provides some insight about CitiBike customers, such as high traffic locations and possible sociological implications when compared with income level and residential information.

To explain each visualization, please refer to the list below:

* Starting Locations for Users: This heatmap of starting locations shows the prevalence of bikesharing in Manhattan, with some usage in the other boroughs. This should be compared with other monthly data to understand if the program expansion efforts are improving.
* End Locations for Users: This heatmap of ending locations - and its similarity to the starting locations - shows that many customers use CitiBike for round trips.
* Lengths of Trips by Minutes and Hours: This graph shows the general duration of trips by customers. Most customers use the service for less than an hour to make short trips to nearby locations, and often round trips with comparison of starting and ending location trip counts.
* Lengths of Trips by Duration and Gender: This graph shows the general duration of trips by customers by gender. The male-prevalent usage is curious, though further investigation is warranted as it could be a result of a number of different factors.
* Daily Usage Traffic: This heatmap shows the daily usage traffic by hour by customers. Most trips are concentrated in the morning and evening hours around the workday, and even usage on the weekends. What is most interesting about this map is the lack of customers on Wednesdays.
* Daily Usage Traffic by Gender: This heatmap shows the daily usage traffic by hour by gender. This heatmap is consistent with previous visualizations and discussions above.
* Daily Usage Traffic by Usertype: This heatmap shows the overall daily usage traffic by gender. This heatmap is also consistent with previous visualizations and discussions above.

## Summary

These visualizations show the general locations for customers and their usage habits, consistent with metropolitan behavior in congested areas. Two additional visualizations could be generated for additional effect:

* Monthly behavior by location: This could show seasonality of use and let our workforce properly expand as needed.
* Cross-application of residential gender data: To show how gender affects business models, we could further investigate if there is a higher prevalence of gender in certain areas due to other socioeconomic factors.
